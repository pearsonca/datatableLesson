# Instructions

Install the `data.table` package on your machine: `install.packages("data.table")`. For certain operating systems, you may see a note about "OpenMP support", but you can ignore it for this tutorial. If you intend to use `data.table` regularly for its performance advantages, then you'll want to address that warning.

Read the `data.table` [introductory vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html).

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Obtain the "Medicare Data File" via finding it on the listing [here](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets/blob/master/README.rst) (or directly from [here](http://go.cms.gov/19xxPN4), but reading through those publicly available datasets is enlightening). Decompress that file into your clone of this repository.

During the interactive session, we will work through the tutorial in the `tutorial.R` file in this repository.
